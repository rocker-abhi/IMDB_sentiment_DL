Why is customer service so bad these days? Spent 40 minutes on hold just to get transferred to the wrong department. Absolutely frustrating! Companies need to do better. 🤦‍♂️ #BadService

Another rainy day, and of course, my umbrella decided to break right in the middle of my walk. Soaked from head to toe. Mondays really know how to be the worst. 😒 #BadLuck

8️⃣
Tired of seeing influencers promoting useless products just for money. Wish more people would be honest instead of selling things they don’t even use. Social media is getting so fake! #Disappointed

9️⃣
Absolutely exhausted from work. No appreciation, no motivation, and just endless deadlines. Sometimes I wonder if all this effort is even worth it. Burnout is real. 😩 #Stressed

Just tried this "highly rated" restaurant, and it was a total letdown. The food was cold, service was slow, and the prices were outrageous. Never going back! 😡 #WorstExperience
